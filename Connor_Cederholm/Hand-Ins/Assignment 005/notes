1) no driver - no test

2) if you set the attribute as x = attrib1 + attrib2;  that
   is usually done in the constructor. In the attribute list
   it is a little non-effective.

   imagine:
	int a1 = 2;
	int a2 = 3;
	int a3 = a1 + a2;

	why not just say:
	int a3 = 5;

	or maybe you want to do that in order to make
	the code 'self documenting'  

	people do that.
