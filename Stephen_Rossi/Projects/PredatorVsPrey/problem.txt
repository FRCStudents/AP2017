In this simulation, the prey are Zebra and the predators are Lions. These creatures live in a 20 * 20 grid
of cells. Only one creature may occupy a cell at a time. The grid is enclosed, so a critter is not allowed to move
off the edges of the world. Time is simulated in steps. Each creature performs some action every time step.
The Zebra behave according to the following model:

• Move: For every time step, the Zebra randomly try to move up, down, left, or right. If the neighboring
cell in the selected direction is occupied or would move the Zebra off the grid, then the Zebra stays in the
current cell.
• Breed: If an Zebra survives for three time steps, at the end of the time step (i.e., after moving) the Zebra will
breed. This is simulated by creating a new Zebra in an adjacent (up, down, left, or right) cell that is
empty. If there is no empty cell available, no breeding occurs. Once an offspring is produced, an Zebra
cannot produce an offspring again until it has survived three more time steps.
The Lions behave according to the following model:
• Move. For every time step, the Lion will move to an adjacent cell containing an Zebra and eat the
Zebra. If there are no Zebra in adjoining cells, the Lion moves according to the same rules as the
Zebra. Note that a Lion cannot eat other Lions.
• Breed. If a Lion survives for eight time steps, at the end of the time step it will spawn off a new
Lion in the same manner as the Zebra.
• Starve. If a Lion has not eaten an Zebra within three time steps, at the end of the third time step it
will starve and die. The Lion should then be removed from the grid of cells.
During one turn, all the Lions should move before the Zebra.
