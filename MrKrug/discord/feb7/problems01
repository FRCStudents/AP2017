Write a program 

Note: these are one file, one main - until instructed otherwise:
	When you write the following functions, make sure the 
	function is called when the program is compiled and run.

that prints out "Yo, Dudele!"

with a function that prints a line of "*"

with a function that accepts a String, and prints out:
	"This is the "string", you know: (parameter here)"

a function: parameter int, and it prints a line depending on the
value of the parameter. If the parameter is divisible by 6,
it prints "Hah ha 6-divisor dude". Otherwise it prints "(Bummer and a half)"

2 functions:
	first function calls the second - if the second returns
	true, the first function writes "whew". Otherwise, the
	first function write "drag".

	the second function takes a parameter of a String, and
	returns true if the first letter is a vowel. Otherwise
	it returns false.

Write a class that has 1 attribute (int) and a constructor
that initializes the attribute to 17

Write a class that has 1 attribute (int) and a constructor 
that accepts an int and sets the attribute to the new
value - but defaults to 17.

Write a toString method on each of the previous two classes.
	The toString method should print out the attribute 


Write two classes. One class instatiates the second class.
The second class has a method "printStars()" that prints
a row of stars.
The first class has a method "printStarLines()" that
instantiates the second class and uses the method printStars().
