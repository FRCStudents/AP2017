Card - one instantiation for each card in the deck
	isEqual(Card c)
	
Deck - the full deck of 52 cards
	shuffle() - what you may expect
	dealCard() - keeps a pointer and returns next card
	isEmpty() - returns boolean

	so you can: while(!isEmpty()) dealCard();

Table - 1) 9 card grid for the table
	2) the ability to check the 9 card grid for an
		elevens match (2 cards) or a royalty
		match (3 cards)
	3) the ability to check the table against itself
	4) the ability to check the table against the next card dealt

	5) keep a discard list

Game -  1) deal first 9 cards
	2) while (there is a match in the 9 card grid){
		deal a new card
		
	3) while (there are cards in the deck){
		c = dealCard()
		check table against card (c)
		while(pile can be played on the table)
		fill table back up

	4) print pile
	5) print table
