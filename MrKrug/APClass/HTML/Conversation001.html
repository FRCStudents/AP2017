Hey Will, at this point, do you have a working computer?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 10:57 AM
Yes
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 10:57 AM
How did you do on the APLine project?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 10:58 AM
What do you mean?
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 10:58 AM
Did the substitute hand out an AP Test question - APLine?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 10:58 AM
Yes
And we typed it
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 10:58 AM
DId everyone do it together?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 10:59 AM
no not really, ik some people worked on it together but not everyone
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 10:59 AM
did you get it done?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:00 AM
yes
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:00 AM
awesome!
did you test it?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:00 AM
yes it compiled on linux
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:01 AM
did it run
?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:01 AM
i think so
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:01 AM
did you create a driver with a main?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:02 AM
no
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:02 AM
ah hah...
did you put a main in the APLine?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:02 AM
one sec
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:02 AM
this is Sunday... you don't have to respond now... I don't mean to invade your privacy!
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:03 AM
i just wanted to pull it up, no i have no main
which is why on windows it wont compile
if i remember right
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:03 AM
it should compile on windows also...
but it won't run without a main!
In order to test it, you need to write another file (we have been calling a driver)
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:04 AM
thats what i meant
on linux though it ran without a main if i remembering right
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:04 AM
I can't run without a main
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:04 AM
ok, im probally wrong then
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:05 AM
you probably compiled it, and were tired of working on it by then
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:05 AM
probably
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:05 AM
so you said "it compiled... that's good"
been there... done that
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:05 AM
that sounds like basically what i did so
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:07 AM
so, in class on Monday, I am going to say something like "You all need to have written a main - or a driver - to test your program"
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:07 AM
ok
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:07 AM
If you want to take advantage of the fact that I am here now... and willing to answer questions.... you can
But, I understand that you were already engaged in something else...
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:08 AM
i dont really understand how to write the driver part.
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:09 AM
Do you want to talk about it now for a few minutes?
(in text....)
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:09 AM
if that works sure
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:09 AM
do you want to tell me what you would do to write a driver? Or should I start telling you what I would do?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:10 AM
second option, as im not really sure what im supposed to do
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:10 AM
ok
so - I have a class called APLine
in a file called APLine.java
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:11 AM
ok
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:11 AM
and it compiled... and I feel pretty good about that
now I need to start writing my driver in another file
let's say - I write class APLineDriver
in my file APLineDriver.java
then I know how to start...
class APLineDriver {
so far so good?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:12 AM
ok
yeah
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:12 AM
then, really, all i need is a main
i don't need any attributes
i don't need any getters or setters
so , my next line is
public static void main (String [] argv){
do you understand that line?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:13 AM
kind off
i get its returning nothing, but i dont get why string and argv is there
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:14 AM
good
do you know linux?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:14 AM
yes and no
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:14 AM
do you know the 'cat' command?
or on windows, the 'type' command?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:15 AM
no
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:15 AM
what commands do you know?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:15 AM
not a lot actually
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:15 AM
we just need one
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:16 AM
i know sudo, chmod basic stuff
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:16 AM
let's talk about chmod
how do you change a file?
chmod +x filename
changes filename to an executable, right?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:17 AM
i belive so
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:17 AM
ok.
so the project that you are running is called chmod
theoretically, if it was written in java - there would be a chmod.java file somewhere
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:17 AM
ok
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:18 AM
but chmod is reading other stuff -
it sees the +x
and now it knows what it has to do
and it sees the "filename" and it knows what file it has to do it to
does this make sense?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:18 AM
yes
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:19 AM
btw - nobody else in class knows this stuff yet...
so what happened?
if chmod were a java program (which it is not) - then it would have a main
public static void main(String[] argv){
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:20 AM
ok
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:20 AM
the argv is the name of a list (array) of Strings
the first String in the lists has the value "+x"
the second String in the list has the value "filename"
and in main, we have something like:
if (argv[0].equals("+x")){
make the file executable....
}
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:21 AM
ok
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:22 AM
does this make any sense (it's way complicated...)
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:22 AM
it kind of does
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:22 AM
So now - the short, simple, answer is "argv is an array of Strings that your program can read from the command line"
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:22 AM
ohh
ok
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:23 AM
so, if we wanted, we can make it so that we have:
java APLineDriver 4 5 6
and the first string will be "4"
and the second will be "5"
and the third will be "6"
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:24 AM
i see
so when you go to run it you can set values?
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:24 AM
?
yes!
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:24 AM
ok
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:25 AM
you can set your main to read the values, and then instatiate the object using those three values
that way - you can test it over a series of values without recompiling each time...
that is all cool, but completely tangential
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:26 AM
i see
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:26 AM
do you still have time to talk about the rest of main
?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:26 AM
i have time yes
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:26 AM
ok
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:26 AM
im not busy at the molment
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:26 AM
ok
so - then the next line of our main function is where we instantiate the object
that is the line : APLine apline = new APLine(4,5,6);
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:28 AM
ok
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:28 AM
Then, I can test my functions...
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:29 AM
i get errors
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:29 AM
ok
can you show me your code?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:30 AM
yeah
public class APLineDriver{
    public static void main (String [] argv);
    APLine apline = new APLine(4,5,6);
}
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:31 AM
remember - main is a function or method
and a method is written in the following pattern:
functionName (...){.... }
can you see what's wrong with your main?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:31 AM
i lack brackets
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:32 AM
you do indeed!
did that solve the errors?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:32 AM
no
i still get it
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:32 AM
what is the error?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:32 AM
"APLineDriver.java:2: error: missing method body, or declare abstract
        public static void main (String [] argv);{"
with a pointer to the m in main
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:33 AM
look at the pattern I wrote...
and compare it to the pattern of your main...
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:33 AM
oh
i see it
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:33 AM
!
yay?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:33 AM
yeah that worked
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:34 AM
yay!
now you have run your class!
well, not quite, first you have to run it - that is - >> java APLineDriver
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:34 AM
that runs
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:34 AM
cool!
did it do anything?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:35 AM
no just ran
didnt tell it to output anything
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:35 AM
can you tell it to output something so you can see that it works/doesn't work?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:36 AM
yes but im unsure what to tell it to print oubt
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:36 AM
what do you want to test?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:36 AM
im unsure?
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:36 AM
that's code for, "what was the test question?"
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:38 AM
it wants the return of the slope i think, and a value of true or false for isonline
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:38 AM
so, i would think that would be the output you want to check?
in other words, you may want to identify a line
and two points - one point on the line, and one point NOT on the line
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:39 AM
i think
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:39 AM
and test them... to make sure the one on the line comes back true(edited)
and then look at the slope, and check if it is correct or not?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:40 AM
i belive so
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:41 AM
can you figure out how to output those tests?
those points?
the slope?
don't change the class APLine
only the driver!
the command to print to the screen is System.out.println
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:42 AM
im confused how i would go about doing that
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:42 AM
ok
will you show me your code for APLine?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:42 AM
sure
mym bad
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:43 AM
i was going to ask for that next
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:43 AM
then this is the driver "public class APLineDriver{
    public static void main (String [] argv){
    APLine apline = new APLine(4,5,6);
    system.out.print()
}
}" and ill send APLine in right  now
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:44 AM
notice - it is System.out.print() now system...
also - it prints out the parameter you send it
System.out.print("Stuff")
prints "Stuff"
System.out.print()
doesn't print anything
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:45 AM
ok
i see
and this is APLine
<pre>
APLine "public class APLine{

    int a=3;
    int b=4;
    int c=5;

    public APLine(int n1, int n2, int n3) {
        a = n1;
        b = n2;
        c = n3;
    }
    public double getSlope(){
        return -a/b;
    }
    public boolean isOnLine(int x, int y){
        int line=(ax)+(by)+c;
        if(line==0){
            return true;
        }else{
            return false;
        }

    } "
</pre>
yea i knew it wouldnt print anything, i wasnt sure what to put there
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:46 AM
ok
so in your driver you have the line that intantiates the object
so the line exists...
a = 4, b  = 5, c = 6
hang on, I need to leave for about 5 minutes... i'll be right back
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:48 AM
ok
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:50 AM
sorry about that
so the line itself is 5x + 6y + 7 = 0
do you know how to find slope?
y = mx + b?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:53 AM
yeah?
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:54 AM
6y = -5x - 7 ==> y = (-5/6)y - (7/6)
is that right?
no - it should be y = (-5/6)x - (7/6)
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:55 AM
yeah
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:55 AM
then - we know what the slope should be... cool!
let's print out the slope and see if it is right
System.out.print("Slope: " + apline.getSlope());
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:57 AM
ok
that ran
got a slope of 0,0
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:58 AM
is that right?
i.e. should the slope be 0.0?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 11:58 AM
i dont think so
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 11:58 AM
me either
any ideas?
the answer is going to have something to do with datatypes
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:00 PM
the ints?
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:00 PM
int / int gives you an int
it simply truncates - or lops off - any decimal part
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:01 PM
yes
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:01 PM
any idea how to fix it?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:01 PM
change it to doubles?
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:01 PM
try it
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:03 PM
it spits a error of incompatable types when i compile for line 16
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:04 PM
ok
what is your line 16
?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:04 PM
int line=(ax)+(by)+c;
oh its a int
ok got slopes -0.8 that timee
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:05 PM
cool!
and we said the slope should be -5/6
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:07 PM
yes
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:07 PM
5/6 = .833333
okay... i'm ok with that
what about checking the other fuction - isOnLine
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:07 PM
ok
would i do the same thing? just rename the getslope part to isonline?
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:08 PM
nope... you have two different functions
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:08 PM
ok
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:09 PM
the idea, is that if you pass a point (x,y) to "isOnLine" it will tell you true or false
so i would test it with 2 points - one on the line, and one not on the line
can you find those points?
(this is the algebra)
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:10 PM
arnt the 2 points given in APLine?
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:10 PM
in the problem?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:11 PM
yeah
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:11 PM
i don't remember
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:11 PM
the double line= part
int line=(axx)+(bxy)+c;
x=*
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:12 PM
talk me though it... where are the points?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:12 PM
on the axis's?
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:13 PM
what would they be?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:13 PM
x and y?
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:13 PM
we need numbers, not variables
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:14 PM
a is 3 and b was 4 if thats what you meant?
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:14 PM
our equation is
0 = Ax + By + c
A = 4
B = 5
C = 6
therefore
0 = 4x + 5y + 6
if x = 0 then
0 = 0 + 5y + 6
-6 = 5y
-6/5 = y
not an int... and our program is set up for ints, right?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:16 PM
wasnt it changed for doubles?
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:16 PM
only the slope
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:16 PM
oh yeah X and Y are ints
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:17 PM
I thought the constructor was ints
so let's try again
0 = 4x + 5y + 6
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:17 PM
oh yeah constructor is
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:18 PM
-6 = 4x + 5y
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:18 PM
my bad
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:19 PM
this 4,5,6 line is hard... maybe we can make an easier line?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:19 PM
i dont think so?
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:19 PM
0 = Ax + By + C
We can make A,B,and C anything we want...
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:20 PM
yeas
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:23 PM
What about 0, 1,2?
0 = 0x + 1y + 2
-2 = y
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:23 PM
yeah
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:23 PM
then we can test with point (23, -2)
and point (23,-3)
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:24 PM
23?
ok
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:24 PM
whatever
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:24 PM
oh yeah yeah
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:24 PM
it just gets multiplied by 0
but that doesn't seem like the best test
but it's an ok test
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:25 PM
ok
i think i get it
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:26 PM
cool!
so - that's how you would use your driver to test your code
you have two lines:
System.out.println("Slope: " + apline.getSlope());
System.out.println("On line: " + apline.isOnLine(23,-2));
System.out.println("Not On Line: " + apline.isOnLine(23,2));
then you compile your driver, and run it, and see what you get!
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:30 PM
ok
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:30 PM
Is there any way we can share this conversation with the rest of the class? They would benefit a lot!
Or - would you feel in the lime light?
If you don't want to share it... maybe it's possible to change our names and share it?
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:31 PM
i dont mind it being shared either way
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:32 PM
go back over it and make sure you are good with everything we said being in front of the class
(i'm going to...)
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:33 PM
yeah i think its fine
<br><br><b>Mr   Krug:</b>    - Yesterday at 12:34 PM
Awesome...
<br><b>Yukari:</b>  - Yesterday at 12:34 PM
yeah
thank you

it turns out, i have no idea how to publish a private conversation!
do you know?

you could just copy and paste the whole convo? although i dont know if that would format correctly
yeah you could just copy and paste it, it seems to format fine on my end
