HelloWorldVariations:
	error: class HelloWorld is public, should be declared in a file named HelloWorld.java

	fix: renamed class to name of file ("HelloWorld" --> "HelloWorldV1")
	------------------------
	error: Class names, 'HelloWorldV4', are only accepted if annotation processing is explicitly requested

	fix: Tried compiling again, worked??????? Maybe I didn't save it?????????????
