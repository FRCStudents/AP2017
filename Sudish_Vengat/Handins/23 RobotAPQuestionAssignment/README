Hi Sudish  -

I don't think you quite got the function hallIsClear.

It's true - you could pass the AP question without it.... but
evidently I expect more from you than the AP folks!

Please fix it!

Also, your test keeps coming back 0 - that can't be right!
I usually get 20 - 40 moves... and you don't get any!

let me know!
