Hi Sudish -

Interesting...

A couple things that won't work

1) if while(...) - 

	if statement is like this:
		if(condition)...

	while statement is like this:
		while(condition)...

	you could say something like:

		if(condition){
			while(condition){
				...
			}
		}

and 2)
	when I looked in the oracle documentation, I did not
	see anything like String.find()...

	I might have missed it. But if it's not there, it is
	good to find out what methods you have before you code!

	In any case, good work! and good luck getting it!
