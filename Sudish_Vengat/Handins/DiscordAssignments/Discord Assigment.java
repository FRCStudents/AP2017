/*
Problem – we are going to run a program, but in order to operate effectively we need to know the state of our computer. We keep a log of that state in a file called “Status.txt”. If it exists, we read it and continue properly. If it does not exist, we initialize it… but we need to keep track of that step in our log file.
1)    Open and read a file (“Status.txt”)
2)    If the file is not there:
a.    Write the file 
i.    One line: “This file has been initialized”
3)    If the file is there:
a.    Print the file to the console
4)    Either way – if the file is there or not – 
a.    Create another file “log.txt”
b.    This file should be written either:
i.    “Our file was read properly”, or
ii.    “Our file was initialized properly”
