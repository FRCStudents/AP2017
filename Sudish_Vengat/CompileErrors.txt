Compile Errors:

	error: class HelloWorld is public, should be declared in a file named HelloWorld.java 
	
	fix: I renamed the class as the name of the file (i.e. changed "HelloWorld" to "HelloWorldVariation2")
	
	
	error: bad operand types for binary operator '-'
	
	fix: I changed '-' to '+' (i.e. changed "HelloWorlds" "-= s" to "HelloWorl" "+= d"
