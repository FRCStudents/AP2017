For your edification to work for your computer: 
	-change the string “path” in the method writeTextFile in partOne.java
	-type in ‘pwd’ in the command prompt for whatever directory where these files are 
	saved and change it so that it will save the text files into wherever you are 
	working. You could also make a copy of my file so that you don’t mess it up but whatever.

**Also, to display the contents of a text file you made, type ‘more’ and the text file name in the command prompt.
