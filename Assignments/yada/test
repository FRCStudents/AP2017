In order to get this, you must see the code for Yada.java and SubYada.java

1) What is printed to console (if anything) when you run StressTest?

2) Which object is working as the driver?

3) Which object is the 'parent' object?

4) Which object is the 'child' object?

5) Which function is overloaded?

6) Which function is overridden?

7) Which attributes are inherited?

============================================================================

/question02:

8) Please show me what is printed to console (if anything).

9) Which function is overloaded?

10) Which function is overridden?

11) One way to visualize this is 5 sets and each set has 3 strings.
    How would you set the 3rd string in the 5th set with "Yo, Mama!"?

12) Please write a loop that will put "Yo, DUDE!" into the following:
	The first spot in the first set,
	The second spot in the second set,
	and the third spot in the third set.
