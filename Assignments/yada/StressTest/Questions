1) Write a class called "Yada"

2) Yada must have one int attribute called YadaNumber

3) Yada must have one String attribute called YadaString

4) Write a constructor for Yada: 
	the constructor should set the YadaNumber to 0, and
				the YadaString to "ThisThing";

5) Write another constructor for Yada that accepts two parameters
	and sets YadaNumber and YadaString to those parameter values.

6) Write a method called "spillYada" that prints out the YadaString
	YadaNumber times.

	In other words, if YadaNumber is 2 and YadaString is "This", 
	spillYada will print "This" 2 times.

	This
	This

7) Write a driver called YabbaDabbaDo 

8) The driver must instantiate Yada and run spillYada

9) Write a class called SubYada

10) SubYada must inherit everything from Yada - including attributes and 
methods.

11) Override spillYada method -

	the new spillYada will do exactly the same thing, but it will print
	"**" before each line:

	**This
	**This

12) Write a class called YadaNum

13) YadaNum should have an attribute - a 5 X 5 double array of int

14) YadaNum should have a method to print the double array

15) YadaNum should have a method to set a number in a specific spot.

16) YadaNum should have a constructor that fills the array with 7s.

17) Now write the code to fill the array with an X of 0's - that so 
that it will look like this: 

	0	7	7	7	0
	7	0	7	0	7
	7	7	0	7	7
	7	0	7	0	7
	0	7	7	7	0
