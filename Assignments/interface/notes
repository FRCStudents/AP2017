IUser - fine

User - implements IUser - fine

User1 - implements IUser... but has no showUser function at all
   * compile error:
	User1.java:4: error: User1 is not abstract and does not override abstract method showUser(int) in IUser

User2 - implements IUser... but showUser does not take an int parameter
   * compile error:
	User2.java:4: error: User2 is not abstract and does not override abstract method showUser(int) in IUser

User3 - overloads showUser
	Works, compiles and runs

User4 - exact compy of User3 (except User3 -> User4)
	Compile and run AppRun4 and User4
	Then, after compile, I will change User4.showUser
	Recompile, and run

User5 - same experiment, but no interface
	Works fine...

User6 - implements IUser6a and IUser6b
	Works fine...

User7 - implements IUser7a, IUser7b and Comparable
