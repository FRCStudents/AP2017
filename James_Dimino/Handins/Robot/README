Hi James...

Rethink a loop... try this:

If I have 10 stacks of paper on the table, I can do one of these
two things:

1) I can go through the whole line and pick up a page from each stack... or else:

2) I can go to the first place,
		pick up one page,
		go to the next place,
		pick up one page...

In number#1 - I am doing everything all altogether

In number#2 - I am doing everything, but ONE STEP AT A TIME...


So... In number one - I say: Do number #1... and i am finished.
With number #2 - I say:
	For each spot:
		do #2

Both approaches do the same thing. We need to break it down for the
second approach. One step at a time.

In java, #1 is like this:

	for(int i=0; i < end; i++){
		stack--;
	}

and #2 is like this:
	
	int pickUpPage(int x){
		return x--;
	}

	void pickItAllUp(){
		for(int i=0; i < end; i++){
			pickUpPage(arry[i]);
		}
	}

Again, it is a *very* subtle difference... but it is the answer to the
question "Where do I put the for loop?"

	In your function move() - do you:
		1) put your for loop in the move() function and call that 
		function exactly one time? Or do you put your for loop 
		OUTSIDE the move() function, and call it over and over
		until the hall is clear?

		2) put your for loop OUTSIDE the move() function, and
