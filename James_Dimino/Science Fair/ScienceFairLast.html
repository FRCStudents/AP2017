        <div class="para1">
          <p>The Calculator has a variety of functions that build off of eachother which forms one main function that runs the caluclator called "determineResults".</p>

          <h3>The Procedure</h3>
          <p>1) The user inputs their personalized responses to each question.<br>2) When user clicks the submit button, program will begin to decipher the information in a function called "convertQuestionsToVals". This function gathers all responses and stores them as an answer<br><tab> value of either 1, 2 or 3 for each individual question.<br>3) After the answer values are stored, the program then searches for any questions the user may have forgotten to answer.<br><tab>3a) If the user forgot to answer a question, an alert will prompt them to answer all the questions.<br><tab>3b) If the user answered all the questions, the program will move onto the next function.<br>4) The next function, "calcBTCost", calculates your build time cost, which is how much it will cost you for the time you spend building the computer.<br><tab>4a) Build time cost is based off of your annual salary, which is converted to minute - minute salary in a seperate function.<br>5) The program compares the money saved, which is determined by multiplying users budget by .186, to build time cost to determine if the user should build or buy a computer.<br><tab>5a) If the program determines that you should buy a pre-built computer, it will prompt the user with two options for computers that meet their purpose for the computer they are buying, cheap and expensive.<br><tab>5b) If the program determines that you should build your own computer, it will recommend you a cheap and expensive parts list for building a computer. The program will also prompt you with <br><tab>two sources to help you build a computer in case you are a first time builder.</p>
