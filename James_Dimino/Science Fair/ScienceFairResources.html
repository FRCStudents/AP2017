              <h2>Newegg</h2>
              <p>Newegg is very similar to Microcenter in its utility and inventory. They offer similar <br>discounts in similar quantities, as well as carrying many of the same brands. The primary <br>differences between the two websites are the brands that they have discounts on, meaning <br>which website you use comes down to circumstance and personal preference. Run your parts <br>list through both websites to see whether the discounts apply to your computer better <br>on Newegg or Microcenter.</p>

              <h2>Amazon</h2>
              <p>Amazon is unique from the other websites used in our research in that it is not a dedicated <br>computer parts website. As such, it does not have the dedicated bundles and discounts that a <br>computer parts website has, so in many circumstances it should not be the first choice in picking <br>a website. However, it has a unique advantage over the other websites through its Prime service. <br>If the products that you want to buy are available through the Prime service, the free, fast shipping <br>provided may prove to be more of a discount than the discounts on the dedicated website. Therefore, <br>before you order your parts from a dedicated PC parts website, try running your shopping list through <br>Amazon to see if Prime saves you more than the dedicated savings.</p>
