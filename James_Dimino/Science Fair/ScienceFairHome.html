    		<h2>Our Project</h2>
    		<p>In order to help provide a stepping stone into the complex world of computers for ordinary people, a website has been built which calculates whether they should pre-build or buy their PC, and recommends options depending on the results they get. Our hypothesis states that if we attempt to create a website which tells users whether they should build or buy a computer, then we will need to code a program which takes inputs of the users financial information and tech expertise and uses them to determine whether they should build a computer or buy a prebuilt one.
        To build this website, data was used from the previous years project to determine that an average of 18.6% is saved when building a computer vs buying a computer. This data was then used to write a function in our program that takes the budget that the user has and multiply it by .186, and save that number as a value.  
        Before we built our actual website, a series of test programs were built using Java. The first was essentially an outline of the project, detailing the various functions and their outputs. It implemented the above function for finding the savings, alongside several other functions. The first was a program for calculating income per minute by taking the users annual salary and dividing it by 124,800. (Fifty-Two Weeks, Forty hours per week, Sixty minutes per hour). The next function took the answers to questions as variables and used those variables to estimate the amount of time the user would take to build a computer. The final function in this prototype program compared the amount saved to the time multiplied by the income per minute, a variable known as buildTimeWorth, to determine whether the user should build or buy. The second prototype program essentially did the same thing, except it took inputs through a command prompt interface and printed out suggestions for PCs to build or buy, depending on the information you entered for the survey questions. The final product took these ideas and entered them into a website, which conducts a survey to determine the above variables, runs them through the above calculations, and returns a set of recommendations. Thus, our hypothesis was correct, as we built a website which tells each individual user whether they should build or buy.
