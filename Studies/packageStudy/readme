I have created 3 different organizations of the same file:

1) No organization - everything is in one directory
	compile Furniture.java
	compile Chair.java
	compile useChair.java
	run useChair 

2) Directory organization
	my useChair is in the first directory, and
	my objects, Furniture and Chair are in a directory
	called ./furniture

	Now - I need to compile everything carefully, then
	run my program with a classpath directive.

	The class path tells 'java' where to find classes.

	I have three examples of this - two bomb and one works.

3) Directory and package organization
	I have compiled my package files with a "package furniture;"
	directive, and then I used javac -d . file_name.java

	That creates a ./furniture directory, and places the .class
	files there. I did that for both Furniture.java and Chair.java.

	Next, I compile useChair.java with an 
	"import furniture.Chair;" directive. 

	Then I run it - java runChair
