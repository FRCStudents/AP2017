Animals.java - is an interface (not public)
MammalInt.java - is an object extending the interface


These files were compiled in the class directory, and then
compiled using the following command:
>> javac -d . Animals.java
>> javac -d . MammalInt.java

These commands put the resulting 'class' files in the 'animals' 
directory - because of the line 'package animals;'.

The way to run this file is:
>> java animals/MammalInt

Notice: you have to run it with the "java" command.
Notice: you have to give it the directory created by the javac -d flag.
