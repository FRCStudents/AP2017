hi alex,

it seems that you have two objects, an APCompNerd and a driver.

The driver has an attribute of a list of APCompNerds.

Within that list, you may want to swap nerds. But I think, on
the more specific level of specific object (APCompNerd), swapping
doesn't make sense.

What do you think?

Best,
